The Firebase SDK might throw an error if the rules in your Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore are improperly configured. For example, if you try to write data to a location that your security rules don't allow, you'll get a permission denied error. Similarly, if your rules are too permissive, you could expose your data to unauthorized access.  Another error could occur if you attempt to access data with invalid keys or paths.
