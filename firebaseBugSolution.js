To fix these errors, carefully review your Firebase security rules to ensure they correctly allow and deny access based on your application's requirements. Use appropriate data validation techniques to prevent invalid data from causing errors. When accessing data, use the correct keys and paths to avoid errors related to improper data retrieval. For instance, instead of directly accessing a child node, use get() or update() methods to retrieve or modify data securely.
